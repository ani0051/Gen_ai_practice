Generative AI (GenAI) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new content, such as text, images, music, code, and even videos, by learning patterns from existing data. Unlike traditional AI models that classify or analyze data, generative AI models generate original outputs that mimic human creativity.
