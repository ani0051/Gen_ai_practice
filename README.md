## Software Engineer Role Matcher using LLM Chain
This project demonstrates a simple application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to match job roles with descriptions using a prompt-based chain. Given a job role and a description, the system generates a meaningful output or summary using LLM capabilities.

🚀Features:

Accepts job role and description as inputs

Uses LLM to generate intelligent responses or summaries

Demonstrates prompt chaining for simple HR-tech or job-matching scenarios

Built with Python, suitable for integration in AI-driven platforms

🧰Tech Stack:

Python 🐍

LangChain (for prompt chaining)

OpenAI/Groq (for LLM response generation)
